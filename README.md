Conformer Dev is a Comprehensive tool for Web Accessibility. Conformer Dev addressed all the above mentioned issues with the existing systems. Basically it is a web application where developers can sign up and Add their projects which can be connected to their GitHub repository, which can be cloned from their repository whenever needed. In other words, No more uploads. But if the developer indents to do so, a web based file manager is also included in the project.

Each file in the project can be evaluated against Accessibility Issues and Static HTML Validation issues. All the issues can be easily addressed with a help search engine which searches the issue with similar forum pages who had faced the same issue and how they solved it.
Conformer Dev is built for Developers, who are interested in Quick Access to information. We built a custom dashboard where developers can understand which accessibility issues they are having a hard time with. Also there are numerous graphs, charts and plots which can deliver a lot of information about themselves at a glance.


1.4.1 OBJECTIVES
Conformer Dev is built with keeping some important objectives in mind.
Every individual should have equal access to the world wide web
Equipp developers to serve their content to differently abled people.
Point out the areas where developers lack their skill in implementing web accessibility
Conformer Dev teams aims to make Internet an accessible space where there are nothing which canâ€™t be read by a screen reader, where there is no blackout contrasts 


1.4.2 ACHIEVEMENTS
Implementing our plan was a tedious task, we had to look over different programming conventions and naming conventions. As part of our Release candidate we gave our RC to the same developers who we sampled as part of the survey, we got a very positive response. We were able to achieve very robust results in very less time. Also the graphs and plot modelled large amounts of code validations accurately. 

We look forward to a bright future for Conformer Dev, we plan to host this as a Software as a Service (SaaS) on the Internet after analyzing the technical and economic feasibility.
